            On the Monday, we were introduced to Flexbox and shown how it can be used to visually enhance our HTML
            files. I was encouraged to play around with what Flexbox can achieve, as can be seen in the screenshot
            examples below.

            On the Friday, we were given time to complete our online journals.
            This gave me the opportunity to revisit what I had learnt so far.
            It also made me realise how much I had managed to learn in the first three weeks.
