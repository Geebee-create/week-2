    <div>
        <h2>Topics Included: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Flexbox and SQL</h2>

    <div>
        <h2>Monday 22nd January</h2>
    </div>

    <p>On the Monday morning, we were encouraged to do more practice on Codewars.
    I worked out the solution (shown below), but I had to research some of the sections on the internet.

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Monday afternoon, we were introduced to Flexbox and shown how it can be used to visually enhance our HTML
            files. I was encouraged to play around with what Flexbox can achieve, as can be seen in the screenshot
            examples below.

    <div>
        <h2>Tuesday 23rd January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>On the Tuesday, we looked deeper into SQL and learnt about 3NF and entity relationship diagrams.
            We were challenged with altering example databases into 3NF.

    <div>
        <h2>Wednesday 24th January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>On the Wednesday we looked at creating simple animations using CSS. I have created one below, which changes
            when hovered over.

    <div>
        <h2>Thursday 25th January</h2>
    </div>

    <p>On the Thursday, we looked deeper into SQL and completed our own mini SQL Project. This included improving a database to
        3NF standard, using SQL statements to create the table in JDoodle, making an entity relationship table,
        performing CRUD operations and querying the database. Below, is a screenshot of the entity relationship diagram
        that I made for this. It is fairly simple due to time restrictions.
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>Friday 26th January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Friday, we were given time to complete our online journals.
            This gave me the opportunity to revisit what I had learnt so far.
            It also made me realise how much I had managed to learn in the first three weeks.
