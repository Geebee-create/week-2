        <h1>Week 7</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Topics Included: React, Intermediate JavaScript, C#</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Monday 19th February</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            To start the week, we were introduced to React. This included learning about components (inc differences
            between class and functional) and the use of
            props. As you can see in the images below, I experienced using create-React-app for the first time and the
            writing of components.
        </p>
    </div>

        <figcaption class="imagecaption">Here you can see the code as it appeared on the web page.</figcaption>
    </div>

    In the afternoon, we were given a challenge which included the insertion of images using React. Rather than being
    shown how to do this straight away, we were challenged with researching how to do it ourselves. As you can see in
    one of the screenshots below, I worked out how to insert a picture of my dog using props.

    <div>
        <h2>Tuesday 20th February</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>On the Tuesday, we learnt about coding paradigms. This included studying the differences between procedural
            programming, event driven programming and object oriented programming. We were also tasked with choosing the
            most suitable coding paradigm for a range of case studies.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Wednesday 21st February</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Wednesday, we continued the study of React. We looked further into the use of props. Also, we were
            introduced to the use of state, the map method and onClick. We were tasked with creating a lookalike of the
            BBC sport website and asked to store images, categories and titles in objects with a state hook. We were
            instructed to then iterate through them using the map method.
        </p>

            lookalike.</figcaption>

    <div>
        <h2>Thursday 22nd February</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>
        On the Thursday, we were introduced to learning how to use C#. We used it to create a dice roller. This involved
        the installation of .net and the creation of a number of files (see screenshot below).
        An example of the code can be seen below:

        <h2>Friday 23rd February</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Friday, of week seven, was another action-packed day with lots of challenges and new content. In the morning
            we were given half an hour to work on Codewars challenges and improve our Kata.
            I completed the challenge below which involved converting a number to a string using JavaScript. As you can
            see by the two images, I answered it in two different ways (one with the use of a template literal).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="allmypics/week7codewars2.jpg" alt=".">

    <div>
        <img src="allmypics/week7codewars1.jpg" alt=".">
        <figcaption class="imagecaption">.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Next, we were put into groups and given React themed tasks to complete in jsComplete. This meant drawing on
            the
            basics we had learnt on Monday and Wednesday and putting them into use. The screenshots below, from this
            activity, show the use of props:
        </p>

        <img src="allmypics/week7reacttask2.jpg" alt="More use of props in jsComplete.">
        <figcaption class="imagecaption"></figcaption>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            For the rest of the day, we learnt about React in more depth. This included learning about the use of
            conditional rendering, controlled components and ternary operators in React.
