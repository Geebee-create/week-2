        <h2>Topics Included: Javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL</h2>

        <h2>Monday 15th January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Monday, we looked at Objects in JavaScript and how they can be used to group related information and
            functions together.
            I wrote the code (pictured below) with the object’s ‘person’ and ‘person2’.
            This allowed me to create sentences of information by adding properties to the objects.

    <!-- I have more of my object examples in week 2 screenshots that I could add to here. -->

        <h2>Tuesday 16th January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> On the Tuesday we were introduced to SQL and played around with inputting data on JDoodle. We discussed
            different data types and what information they are appropriate for storing.
            In the image below, you can see where I was able to delete and select information from a database using SQL.

        <h2>Wednesday 17th January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Wednesday afternoon, we were introduced to HTML and how it can be combined with CSS and JavaScript.
            I created my first HTML files (links at end of sentence), which allowed me to play around with headings,
            paragraphs, lists and the insertion of images.

        <h2>Thursday 18th January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Thursday, we delved deeper into SQL.
            Using a fictional game store database, I was able to use a wide variety of queries to retrieve and
            filter
            specific values and information from the database.
            This included the effective use of operators. Screenshot examples of my use of SQL are below:

        <h2>Friday 19th January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Friday morning, we started the session with training in Codewars.
            This is something that we have been using regularly to improve our JavaScript skills.
            At this stage, I find it challenging and need to do internet searches and check previous notes to work out
            answers.
            However, whilst I currently find it challenging and intimidating, I can see that my future use of Codewars
            will develop my understanding of JavaScript by pushing me.
            We also have a boot camp group on Codewars where we can see each other’s scores and progress.
            An example of a JavaScript solution that I worked out on Codewars is shared below:

    <div>
        <p>Later in the day, we explored how the use of CSS can visually enhance our HTML.
            I then created an external CSS file and began to visually enhance my HTML files (including this journal).
            Below is an image of simple CSS code that we were shown to improve the appearance of text and images:

            On the Friday afternoon, we were given the task of creating presentations, within an hour, to share with the
            group.
            I was put in a group with Ahmed and we were given the subject of the transform property in CSS.
            This was challenging as it was something that we hadn’t learnt about before.
            We described and showed examples of using CSS for rotating, translating, scaling and skewing images.
            We also discussed how transform functions can be used to alter the sizing of text.
            Some screenshots and examples of code, that we shared during our presentation, are shown below:
