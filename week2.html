        <p>
            On the Monday, we looked at Objects in JavaScript and how they can be used to group related information and
            functions together.
            I wrote the code (pictured below) with the object’s ‘person’ and ‘person2’.
            This allowed me to create sentences of information by adding properties to the objects.

    <!-- I have more of my object examples in week 2 screenshots that I could add to here. -->

    <div>
        <p> On the Tuesday we were introduced to SQL and played around with inputting data on JDoodle. We discussed
            different data types and what information they are appropriate for storing.
            In the image below, you can see where I was able to delete and select information from a database using SQL.

        <p>
            On the Wednesday afternoon, we were introduced to HTML and how it can be combined with CSS and JavaScript.
            I created my first HTML file (link at end of sentence), which allowed me to play around with headings,
            paragraphs, lists and the insertion of images.

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Thursday, we delved deeper into SQL.
            Using a fictional game store database, I was able to try use a wide variety of queries to retrieve and
            filter
            specific values and information from the database.
            This included the effective use of operators. Screenshot examples of my use of SQL are below:
