    In the morning session we looked at Objects in JavaScript and how they can be used to group related information and functions together.
    I wrote the code (pictured below) with the object’s ‘person’ and ‘person2’. 
    This allowed me to create sentences of information by adding properties to the objects.

        On the Monday afternoon, we were introduced to HTML and how it can be combined with CSS and JavaScript.
        I created my first HTML file (link at end of sentence), which allowed me to play around with headings, paragraphs, lists and the insertion of images.
