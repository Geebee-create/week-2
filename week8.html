        <h1>Week 8</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Topics Included: React, Fullstack App Design, C#</h2>
    </div>

            In the morning we learnt how to deploy a React app. This allowed
            me to deploy my todo app on Github. A link to this can be seen below:
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href="https://geebee-create.github.io/todo-app/" target="_blank">Click here to see my todo app. It features a
        random positive quote
        generator.</a>

    <!-- had I mentioned my todo app previously? when did I start work on it?, the week before? put about the challenges of it,
         how I pushed myself further with the quote generator. -->

    <div>
        <p>
            In the afternoon we learnt about lifecycle methods in both class and functional components. This included
            learning about ComponentDidMount, ComponentDidUpdate and ComponentWillUnmount. This is a topic that I feel I
            will need to look into in more depth by myself for a greater understanding as the lifecycle of React has
            many stages.

        <h2>Tuesday 27th February</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Tuesday, we were introduced to the requirements of our next project. The topic of the project is the
            design of a fullstack app. We were given the following five design stages to work on:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Stage 1- The Concept</li>
            <li>Stage 2- Requirements</li>
            <li>Stage 3- Data Schema</li>
            <li>Stage 4- Functionality</li>
            <li>Stage 5- Interface Design</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            For my concept (Stage 1), I chose to design a womenswear green fashion app. This allowed me to combine the
            knowledge I
            attained
            when I did an MA in Fashion Buying and Merchandising Management with the knowledge I have attained on the
            bootcamp. I chose for the app to be a virtual sustainable fashion catalogue with images and links to
            sustainable products from various brands. I also decided, at an early stage, that I wanted my app design to
            allow users to become members, make a profile, review sustainable fashion items and share information with
            one another.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            In terms of requirements, I made the following initial list:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Images and links to green fashion items and collections.</li>
            <li>User membership. Users can become a member and leave reviews of these pieces/collections.</li>
            <li>User profiles.</li>
            <li>Following. Users should be able to follow other users and be followed by them. </li>
            <li>Notifications. Users can then get a notification when someone they follow posts and review/comment.
            </li>
            <li>Discussion board. A page where users can discuss sustainable fashion, ask questions and make
                recommendations. </li>
            <li>An index board. This will include a list of sustainable fashion charities, a list of sustainable brands,
                figures of interest like Youtubers.</li>
            <li>A news page/blog where users can comment on posts.</li>
            <li>Users should be able to like and share each other's comments and reviews.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Further ideas for the growth of the app:</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>The news page/blog could also include interviews with people within the fashion industry, on the topic
                of sustainable fashion. Like a virtual magazine.</li>
            <li>It could potentially be expanded to include men's clothing too.</li>
            <li>An optional weekly/monthly newsletter for members. </li>
            <li>Following. Users should be able to follow other users and be followed by them. </li>
            <li>Notifications. Users can then get a notification when someone they follow posts and review/comment.
            <li>Use of buttons for easy sharing other social media sites.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I also began the process of planning the schema and realised that it will need a complicated database with
            many interconnected tables.</p>

            During week 8 we had been asked to research API's. Then, on the Wednesday morning we were asked to
            contribute what we had learnt to a Miro board. A screenshot of the board can be seen below:
        </p>

        <p>
            The rest of the day involved further study of React. We learnt how to handle external data in React
            components
            using
            HTTP requests. We also learnt how to appropriately handle errors when fetching extrernal data. It was really
            interesting to see the wealth and variety of content that can be fetched using an API.

        <figcaption class="imagecaption">We were shown how to fetch data from an API using Thunder Client. This is a

            On the Thursday, we looked further into C# and were guided in the creation of a C# dice factory. Screenshots
            of the C# code I wrote for this lesson can be seen below:
