            To continue our study of JavaScript, we began the week with learning about the call stack. We were given
            examples of
            code and asked to work out the order of
            the call stack. While I found this slightly confusing at first, I was able to accurately break down and
            order a call
            stack by
            the end of the session. We also looked into the difference between global scope, function scope and block
            scope.
            Next, we learnt about higher order functions and how they allow us to use more functions, within another
            function, as
            parameters. We were given a number of higher order function challenges to complete. It took some trial and
            error,
            but I used what I have learnt to create a higher function with arrays (shown below):

            On the Tuesday we looked deeper into what can be achieved with MongoDB. I learnt how to query arrays, how to
            use the
            query filter (as an alternative to MongoDB Shell) and the use of operators and aggregation processes. Some
            screenshots of my work
            are shared below (the second pic shows the use of an operator, in the query filter, to find entries with a
            stock value greater than or equal to 10).

        <p>
            We were also introduced to MongoDB Atlas. I now know how to create a collection in Atlas and how to import
            data into it.

    <p>Midweek, we learnt about asynchronous JavaScript and how it differs from synchronous JS. This included
        learning about the efficient handling of data through the use of callback functions, promises, and async
        and await
        keywords. We were given example JS code, that contains errors, and asked to correct the mistakes. This involved
        adding in the use of async and await. As you can see in examples below, the code is linked to another
        file, named promises.js, which allows the efficient use of promises. In the first two image examples (see below), I corrected code
        (which included inserting async and await) to identify if a number is or isn't even. The third image shows the
        code before I edited it.

    <div>
        <p>We also learnt about object oriented programming (OOP) and its relience on the concept of classes, subclasses
            and
            objects. It is another method that can be used to break up code into smaller, reusable chunks.
