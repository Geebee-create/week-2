            To continue our study of JavaScript, we began the week with learning about the call stack. We were given
            examples of
            code and asked to work out the order of
            the call stack. While I found this slightly confusing at first, I was able to accurately break down and
            order a call
            stack by
            the end of the session. We also looked into the difference between global scope, function scope and block
            scope.
            Next, we learnt about higher order functions and how they allow us to use more functions, within another
            function, as
            parameters. We were given a number of higher order function challenges to complete. It took some trial and
            error,
            but I used what I have learnt to create a higher function with arrays (shown below):

    On the Tuesday we looked deeper into what can be achieved with MongoDB. I learnt how to query arrays, how to use the
    query filter (as an alternative to MongoDB Shell) and the use of operators and aggregation processes. Some screenshots of my work
    are shared below (the second pic shows the use of an operator, in the query filter, to find entries with a stock value greater than or equal to 10).
