        <p> To start off the sixth week, we began working on our escape room projects. For this, I created a user flow
            diagram
            using Miro (see the link below).
            Whilst I found planning my game in detail quite challenging, this was a valuable experience. I know that if
            I were
            to complete a similar challenge now, I would do a better job and complete it with more confidence.
            Requirements of
            the escape room were that it include at least four uses of interaction with inquirer, at least four
            functions that
            influence the users path, and an example of class and subclass. I found it really useful to expand on what I
            had
            learnt in week 5 about the use of inquirer. I chose to do my escape room on the topic of Ancient Egypt, as I
            enjoy
            learning about ancient history and Ancient Egypt has always particularly fascinated me.

            On the Tuesday, we continued our study of databases. I learnt how to connect a simple web form to a MongoDB
            database. I was then able to perfom some simple operations, using the web form, like inserting data and
            retrieving
            specific data.

        <p>
            On the Wednesday, we cracked on with beginning the creation of our escape room games in VS Code. For me, the
            hardest
            part was actually starting to do the code for it. This is because I found the scale of the project quite
            indimidating. However, I found that once I began I was comfortable with using what I have learnt about
            inquirer, and
            I enjoyed the creativity of the process. The area of coding that I found the most challenging is the use of
            classes
            and subclasses. If they had been a more central and necessary part of my game plan I think they may have
            been easier
            to incorporate. However, I still feel like the use of classes and subclasses are something that I need to
            study in
            more depth.

            On Thursday we were given a set of challenges to complete on the topic of project management. This involved
            creating a schema for an archery app. We were also tasked with considering the design/layout of the app.

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the Friday, I continued to work on the creation of my escape room. I found this project really enjoyable.
            I loved the creative process and I managed to create a fully working espace room with a range of challenges
            for the
            player.
            This included the generation of a random number and the inclusion of a riddle.
            I was really please with my organisation of the files, which can be seen in the github link below.
            This project is something that I would love to expand on in the future, perhaps with the creation of visual
            elements.
