        <h4> Currently enrolled in a rigorous three-month Software Development boot camp with The Growth Company, I am
            diligently working towards becoming a front-end Junior Software Developer. This immersive experience covers both
            front-end and back-end development, and it demands the constant application of my creative and analytical
            skills. My journal documents my day-to-day experiences as I delve into programming languages (with a focus
            on JavaScript), web development and software architecture. It serves as a practical record of the challenges
            and successes encountered during this intensive learning journey. Through this boot camp, I am building a
            solid foundation for a career that integrates innovation and logical problem-solving skills.</h4>
