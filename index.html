        <!-- Currently enrolled in a rigorous three-month Software Development boot camp with The Growth Company, I am -->
            <!-- diligently working towards becoming a front-end Junior Software Developer. This immersive experience covers both -->
            <!-- front-end and back-end development, and it demands the constant application of my creative and analytical -->
            <!-- skills. My journal documents my day-to-day experiences as I delve into programming languages (with a focus -->
            <!-- on JavaScript), web development and software architecture. It serves as a practical record of the challenges -->
            <!-- and successes encountered during this intensive learning journey. Through this boot camp, I am building a -->
            <!-- solid foundation for a career that integrates innovation and logical problem-solving skills.</h4> -->
