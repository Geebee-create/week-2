    <h2>My Fave TV shows when I was a kid</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Kenan and Kel</li>
        <li>Dexter's Laboratory</li>
        <li>Pinky and the Brain</li>
    </ol>

    <p>My least favourite was Are You Afraid of The Dark, esp the one with the Ghastly Grinner (don't look it up).</p>


    <h2>What Made Me Interested In Coding</h2>
    <p>I chose to study coding because I love to create. I draw, paint and write, and coding feels like the next step in being able to express my creativity. At school, all I learnt about computers is how to use Microsoft Office, but I've always been curious about what goes on behind the scenes of a website.</p>



    <h2>My Targets On This Course</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To build a solid foundation of coding knowledge that I can add to in the future </li>
        <li>To learn new ways to express my creativity </li>
        <li>Eventually, to be able to build whatever website or app I want </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How am I working towards achieving these goals?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>By completing all activities provided for me</li>
        <li>By enjoying the learning process</li>
    </ul>
