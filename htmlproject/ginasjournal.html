    <h3>Monday 8th January</h3>

    <div>


        <p>On the first day of the bootcamp, I was introduced to fundamentals of JavaScript. These included dot notation
            and data types, and I also experienced using Visual Studio Code for the first time.
            It was really interesting to hear about the varied work and coding experience of other people on the
            bootcamp.
            Below is a screenshot of the first code I created in VS Code. I learnt how to generate a random integer
            between 0 and 10 and how to log it into the console.
        </p>

    <h3>9th and Wednesday 10th January</h3>

    <div>
        <p>
            On the second day, we played around with extracting a character from a string and converting it to upper
            case (see image below).
        </p>
    </div>

        <p>
            We discussed data types in more depth and learnt about how variables allow us to store data. It was also
            interesting to be introduced to a wider range of arithmetic and assignment operators and to use template
            literals for the first time.
            As you can see below, I learnt how to declare a variable by linking ‘firstName’ to Gina. I also learnt how
            to
            update the value of a variable by changing the value of ‘firstName’ to Genie.
            Using let rather than const allowed me to change the value of the variable. I also learnt how to add numbers
            and
            create sentences with variables. The last example shows how variables can easily be embedded into a sting
            with
            the use of template literals.
        </p>

    <h3>Thursday 11th January</h3>

    <div>
        <p>
            On Thursday, we looked into if else again and I wrote the code below.
            Revisiting this really cemented it into my memory.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Next, we looked at arrays and loops (including for and while loops).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="morethurs1.jpg" alt="More examples of if else.">
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I also explored with:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>pop </li>
            <li>unshift</li>
            <li>shift</li>
            <li>slice</li>
            <li>splice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see in the example below, I have been using a lot of comments to annotate my work for future
            reference.
            I enjoyed creating arrays especially to play around with these methods.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this next image, you can see where I used loops with strings and to show the multiples of 2 up to 20.
        </p>
