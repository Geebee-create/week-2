        <h1>More About Me</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>My Interest in Coding</h2>

    <div>
        <p>I want to become a front-end software developer as it will allow me to blend my creativity with
            problem-solving.
            Coding is like crafting; it's a way to transform ideas into something tangible and functional. My diverse
            life
            experiences, including my background in English studies, provide me with a unique perspective and strong
            communication skills; I plan to apply these to software development, as they have enhanced my ability to
            understand user needs. During my formative years, the notion of pursuing a career in software development
            seemed
            unattainable as British comprehensive schools lacked coding education. However, participating in a rigorous
            software development boot camp has shown me that I possess the essential skills needed for this field.
            Learning
            to code opens a world of possibilities, and I want to contribute to the creative force driving technological
            advancements.

        <h2>My Background and Education</h2>
        <p>
            My previous education includes English and Drama A levels, a 2.1 in English BA (Hons) and an MA in Fashion
            Buying and Merchandising Management.
            My work experience is varied and includes retail, bar, office, estate agent and teaching assistant work.
            I also have a PGCE in Primary Education from the University of Manchester.
            While I chose not to continue pursuing a career in primary education, it was an extremely challenging course
            that included:

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Multitasking</li>
            <li>The writing of academic papers on educational psychology</li>
            <li>Preparing and teaching full weeks of lessons for 30+ children</li>
            <li>Completing vast amounts of paperwork and marking</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- can i find any pics from when I taught coding to little ones? -->
    <div>
        <p>
            I am grateful for the experience as it strengthened my stamina and taught me that ultimately, I want to work
            in a business centered, creative role. I was also able to experience the teaching of basic coding skills to
            young children. This opened my eyes to the importance of coding in the modern world, and coding education is
            something that I believe should have been introduced in the primary setting decades earlier.

            Doing an MA in Fashion Buying and Merchandising Management allowed me to explore my interest in sales,
            E-Commerce and sustainability. It improved my tech skills as I was taught how to use Google Analytics,
            Excel, Adobe Illustrate, InDesign and Photoshop. It also enhanced my understanding of the business world and my
            analytical and competitive analysis skills. During my MA, I created the video (shown below) using Canva. I
            received a distinction grade of 78 for this assignment and enjoyed the creative process.

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>As I love to write, I created a blog (linked below). It centers around fashion and wellness, and it allows me
            to put to use the knowledge I attained during my masters degree. I created the website using Wix, however if I were
            to create it again I would make it from scratch with my newly attained knowledge of HTML and CSS.
            Creating a blog has been really useful so far as it has encouraged me to learn about SEO.
