        <h2>My Background, Education & Interest In Coding</h2>
        <p>
            My previous education includes English and Drama A levels, a 2.1 in English BA (Hons) and an MA in Fashion
            Buying and Merchandising Management.
            My work experience is varied and includes retail, bar, office, estate agent and teaching assistant work.
            I also have a PGCE in Primary Education from the University of Manchester.
            While I chose not to continue pursuing a career in primary education, it was an extremely challenging course
            that included:

        <ul>
            <li>Multitasking</li>
            <li>The writing of academic papers on educational psychology</li>
            <li>Preparing and teaching full weeks of lessons for 30+ children</li>
            <li>Completing vast amounts of paperwork and marking</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            I am grateful for the experience as it strengthened my stamina and taught me that ultimately, I want to work
            in a business centered, creative role. I was also able to experience the teaching of basic coding skills to
            young children. This opened my eyes to the importance of coding in the modern world, and coding education is
            something that I believe should have been introduced in the primary setting decades earlier.

            Doing an MA in Fashion Buying and Merchandising Management allowed me to explore my interest in sales,
            E-Commerce and sustainability. It improved my tech skills as I was taught how to use Google Analytics,
            Excel, Adobe Illustrate, InDesign Photoshop. It also enhanced my understanding of the business world and my
            analytical and competitive analysis skills. During my MA, I created the video (shown below) using Canva. I
            received a distinction grade of 78 for this assignment and enjoyed the creative process.
