    <div>
        <p>On the Monday, we covered a lot of information on JS DOM. We learnt about how we can use JS DOM to make
            changes and add elements to a web page.
            Below, I have included some image examples of my use of JS DOM to make webpage alterations.

    <!-- Add more info to the above para about what I learnt and more of the activities I was given to do,
     'I was given a wide range of JS DOM related activities to do and that taught me.....' -->

        <h2>Tuesday 30th January</h2>
    </div>

    <p> On the Tuesday, we used the day to continue studying JS DOM.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Wednesday 31st January</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>On the Wednesday, we studied about keycode generators. I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to make my first
            keycode
            generator.
            Click on the link below to see it.</p>

        <a href="https://geebee-create.github.io/Keycode-Generator/" target="_blank">Visit my first keycode
            generator</a>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>After further reading about keycodes, I learnt that 'event.which' is now deprecated and is now replaced by
            'event.key' and 'event.code'. Whilst 'event.which' can still be used, it may not work on all modern
            browsers. I also learnt about differences between
            ASSCI keycodes (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and JavaScript Char keycodes. JavaScript
            Char keycodes are more versatile and appropriate for handling keyboard interactions in modern web
            development.
            My first keycode generator (linked above) uses 'event.which' to generate ASSCI keycodes. I wanted to create
            a keycode generator to generate JavaScript Char keycodes. I also wanted to make a keycode generator that is
            more modern and visually appealling. Therefore, I created another keyword generator, (linked below) by
            following
            a YouTube video, 'Making a Key Code Generator App Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript', on the channel 'WEB CIFAR'.
            The code for this second keycode generator is more complex and advanced. I will need to continue to study
            the code used for this generator in order to gain a greater understanding of how it creates the desired
            result.

        <h2>Thursday 1st February</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> On the Thursday morning, we looked at JavaScript functions and objects in more depth. This allowed us to
            revisit
            some of the material from the first week and develop a greater understanding of it. I think a big plus point
            of
            this is that it seems to have increased everyone’s confidence. Sessions like this are a reminder that it’s
            important to not only know the ‘how’, but the ‘why’ too. Also, as the boot camp progresses, I realise that
            the
            largest challenge is the development of problem-solving skills. I know this is only something that I
            will
            be able to develop through time and practice.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>In the afternoon, we tackled the creation of drum kits. We were each required to make a digital drum kit
            using
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We were given a file of sounds, and we needed to create code that would generate
            the
            sounds in response to the pressing of keys. Like the keycode generator, this has required the use of adding
            event listeners. The screenshot below shows my drumkit at a functioning stage, before the completion of the
            external CSS file.

        <h2>Friday 2nd February</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        On the Friday we began the process of learning to use MongoDB. I learnt about the differences between MongoDB, SQL and NoSQL. I also learnt MongoDB terminology, how to create
        a MongoDB database and how to make alterations.
        Below are example screenshots:
