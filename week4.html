        <p>On the Monday, we covered a lot of information on JS DOM. We learnt about how we can use JS DOM to make
            changes and add elements to a web page.
            Below, I have included some image examples of my use of JS DOM to make webpage alterations.

    <!-- Add more info to the above para about what I learnt and more of the activities I was given to do,
     'I was given a wide range of JS DOM related activities to do and that taught me.....' -->

        <p>On the Wednesday, I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to make my first keycode generator.
